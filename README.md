# COVID-Visualizations

## Overview
COVID Visualizations is a mapping project that visualizes COVID-19 case rates at the county level in the United States for the year 2020. The map uses proportional and chloropleth representations to showcase variations in case rates, providing insights into the impact of the pandemic across different regions.
